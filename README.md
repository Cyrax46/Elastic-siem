# Elastic siem

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
- Set up a free Elastic account.
- Install the Kali VM.
- Configure the Elastic Agent on the Linux VM to collect the logs and forward it to the SIEM.
- Generate security events on the Kali VM.
- Query to find the security events in the Elastic SIEM.
- Create a Dashboard to visualize security events.
- Create alerts for security events.

## Walkthough
- Step 1: Set up an Elastic Account
- Step 2:Setting up the Linux VM
- Step 3:Setting up the Agent to Collect Logs
